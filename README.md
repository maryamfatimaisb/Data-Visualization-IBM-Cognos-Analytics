ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This repository hosts a data visualization dashboard created using IBM Cognos Analytics to analyze and understand customer attrition (churn) within a telecommunications business offering phone and internet services.




The project utilizes data sourced from the "IBM Teleco Churn Data (Phone and Internet Services)"  to correlate key performance indicators such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and Satisfaction Score with Churn Score and Churn Value. The primary goal is to provide actionable insights for customer retention strategies.




ðŸŽ¯ Key Metrics and Analysis
The dashboard is structured around four main analytical areas, allowing users to drill down into the factors driving customer departure:


Churn and Satisfaction Profile: Analysis of Churn Score and Satisfaction Score against Churn Value.


CLTV Analysis: Examination of CLTV by Satisfaction Score  to determine the financial impact of losing customers at different satisfaction levels.


Customer Status Impact: Exploration of CLTV and Churn Value by Customer Status and Churn Score and Churn Value by Customer Status.



Root Cause Analysis (Churn Reasons): Detailed view of Churn Reason, providing insight into why customers are leaving. Reasons highlighted include "Price too high", "Competition offers better", and issues with "Attitude of Service".



ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations Highlights
The dashboard features multiple interconnected visualizations, including:


Bar Charts: Used to display metrics like CLTV by Satisfaction Score.


Combination Charts: Used to compare trends, such as CLTV and Churn Value by Customer Status.


Bubble Charts/Heat Maps: Used for complex analysis like Churn Reason colored by CLTV sized by Satisfaction Score, where the size and color of the markers represent the magnitude of the related metrics.
